People discovered their hobbies and many made new hobbies like coding, dancing, cooking, singing, etc Busy days had taken from us the time to pursue what we love doing People went back to reading, painting, playing their favourite instrument which earlier remained inside their covers and last but not the least we learnt to be patient, sit at a place and thank God that he still kept us safe!!  We should all be thankful to our warriors, who are exposed to this deadly virus every day We should all be thankful to the doctors, police, NGO volunteers who are working at the ground level Many have lost their lives to this disease We should not let their sacrifice go in vain We should all abide by the rules and stay in until and unless things come back to normal Let’s hope and pray that things come back to normal soon, be it the NEW NORMAL.Thursday, September 10, 2020                                  SYNOPSIS of the BHAGAWAT GITA & the Four YOGAS By SOUMYADYUTI DEY CHOWDHURY     Every piece of art, be it a novel, a poem, a short story, a painting or even a film is a visualisation of ‘something’ he/she saw or listened to with a blend of his/her own thoughts That piece of art becomes a reality which we see through a mask A mask which has several filters of thoughts and realizations That actual ‘something’, whatever it may be then gets filtered again with our own thoughts when we embrace that piece of art This is how art passes on generation after generation, people to people with passage of time  Now in this aspect, if we consider The Upanishads to be piece of art, then The Bhagavat Gita being the essence of the Upanishads is also great piece of art from which if we the extract the real ‘something’ from it, that would be a higher life lesson than that   of just reading out it just like a story and reinterpreting it with our own thoughts   So I am going to extract the essence of Gita in my own way, as said earlier adding my own mask So here it is     CHAPTERWISE SYNOPSIS OF THE GITA    Chapter 1    Arjunaviṣāda-yoga    Apart from the description of the armies arrayed for battle, the Chapter 1 focuses on the problem of saṃsāra, which can be said to be the problem of attachment  kṛpā or rāga , grief  śoka or viṣāda  and delusion  moha  Thus, in short, wrong thinking is the biggest problem in our life     Chapter 2    Sāṅkhya-yoga    In this Chapter, Arjuna becomes a śiṣya by surrendering to Lord Kṛiṣṇa He put forwarded several point of views to show Arjuna the right path to once again took the charge of the war All these points suggest that how right knowledge is the ultimate solution to all our problems    Chapter 3    Karma-yoga    In this chapter, we  Arjuna with respect to the Gita  are told about karma-yoga, which utmost necessary to maintain the harmony of the universe upon which we are dependent Above all selflessly doing ones destined job is the the way to progress and prosperity    Chapter 4    Jñānakarmasannyāsa-yoga    The Lord points out that He initiated the lineage of Vivasvān  Lord Sun , Manu, Ikṣvāku, and others in the beginning of the creation  through the Vedas  is being revived through Arjuna in the form of the Gītā because it had declined by that time, signifining that every act can be a act of prayer if we do it with utmost passion, sincerity and respect    Chapter 5    Sannyāsa-yoga    The most selfish word in the universe is ‘me’ if it’s replaced by a greater ‘we’ then we can renounce the Ego of Individuality and rejoice in the Bliss of the Infinity    Chapter 6    Dhyāna-yoga    This chapter focuses on the inner self and claims that if we can connect to the Higher Consciousness daily we will gain much higher stability in life with a bliss of inner peace just like a Sannyasi    Chapter 7    Jñānavijñāna-yoga    We should live the moments of learning and embrace what we learn That’s the best way to learn anything This is the main focus of the chapter     Chapter 8    Akṣaraparabrahma-yoga    The prime lesson of this chapter is that the most important thing is to have faith in oneself never give up on oneself     Chapter 9    Rājavidyā-rājaguhya-yoga    If we do something good, we are blessed and that blessing is the most valuable gift we can have So we should value our blessings    Chapter 10    Vibhūti-yoga    If we can see the God within ourselves its very simple to see the Divinity all around us in every particle of the universe    Chapter 11    Viśvarūpadarśana-yoga    This chapter is about courage and seeks to have enough surrender to see the truth as it is, no matter how hard it is    Chapter 12    Bhakti-yoga    It is about absorbing our mind and heart in the Supreme Lord    Chapter 13    Kṣetrakṣetrajñavibhāga-yoga    It’s somewhat similar to the previous chapter and it also suggests to detach from Maya and attach to the Devine    Chapter 14    Guṇatraya-vibhāga-yoga    A job or any routine that we do out of pressure is never going to give peace So we should live a lifestyle that matches your vision This the chapter in one line    Chapter 15     Puruṣottama-yoga    The worldly things are temporary, the soul is the ultimate truth that lives forever and that is the blessing of the Divine So we should always give priority to Divinity, not worldly attachments    Chapter 16    Daivāsurasampadvibhāga-yoga    Being Good is a reward in itself is the main thought of this chapter    Chapter 17    Śraddhātrayavibhāga-yoga    Here we understand that choosing the Right over the Pleasant is a sign of Power    Chapter 18    Mokṣasannyāsa-yoga    In the last chapter, Lord Krishna completely changes the mind of Arjuna with his Devine thoughts and visions.&nbsp  Finally, he starts the chariot and let Arjuna do his karma, to let him move to Union with the God    THE WHOLE GITA IN A NUTSHELL    From the simplest point of view, the Bhagawat Gita seems like a story of the embodied soul, personified by Arjuna, who faced a crisis of his life in the middle of the battlefield and stood confused, fearful and worried He also stands for an ideal devotee Lord Krishna, as his charioteer in the battlefield personifies the voice of God and the Supreme Self Out of extreme love and compassion, he taught Arjuna the divine wisdom to remain calm amidst the turbulence of life and perform his duties as a service to God He taught him how to overcome desires, selfishness, duality, attachments, egoism, karma, delusion and ignorance and achieve liberation by practising right action, right knowledge, right contemplation, right perception or discernment and right devotion  But if we go deeper and truly understand, it seems like the Bhagawad Gita teaches us how to live in this world, do our duties and yet remain like the lotus leaves in the water of life The world in which we live is said to be a world of illusion You cannot depend upon it forever, because it is transient and subject to change Out of ignorance and egoism, states the Bhagavadgita, we bind ourselves to it through our desires and desire-ridden actions and suffer from ignorance and delusion, not knowing our true nature and true purpose Having become caught in the snare of desires and delusion, we remain chained to the cycle of births and deaths and to the forces of nature  It also teaches us how to escape from this predicament, not by escaping from the burdens of the worldly life, nor by the avoidance of our duties and responsibilities, but remaining amidst the humdrum of life and facing it squarely with fearlessness, detachment and stability of mind, accepting God as the Doer and the Saviour and performing our actions as part of the sacrifice of life  Thus, the Bhagawad Gita is about human suffering and its resolution through spiritual effort It brings spirituality to worldly life and suggests how to face the challenges and compulsions of human life with faith and devotion, without becoming lost in egoistic pursuits and selfish actions The discourse is about the predicament of humans in the battle of life, with God as its controller    SYNOPSIS OF THE FOUR YOGAS    For our generation in recent years the word &quot yoga&quot  has been heard more in gyms than in religious discourse, &quot yoga&quot  in its original sense has little to do with exercise &quot Yoga&quot  comes from the Sanskrit verb &quot yuj,&quot  to yoke or unite The goal of yoga is to unite oneself with God  the practice of yoga is the path we take to accomplish this  Spiritual aspirants can be broadly classified into four psychological types  the predominantly emotional, the predominantly intellectual, the physically active, and the meditative There are four primary yogas designated to &quot fit&quot  each psychological type     The Path of Love  Bhakti Yoga    Bhakti yoga is the path of devotion, the method of attaining God through love and the loving recollection of God Most religions emphasize this spiritual path because it is the most natural As with other yogas, the goal of the bhakta, the devotee of God, is to attain God-realization--oneness with the Divine The bhakta attains this through the force of love which is the most powerful and irresistible of emotions  There are five stages of love     Man wants help and has a little fear  When God is seen as Father  When God is seen as Mother  Love for Love’s sake  Love in Divine Union    Above all, pure Love has no motive, it has nothing to gain After prayer &amp  praise comes meditation, then comes reflection on the name and on the Ishta of the individual     The Path of Knowledge  Jnana Yoga    Jnana yoga is the yoga of knowledge not knowledge in the intellectual sense but the knowledge of Brahman, Atman and the realization of their unity Where the devotee of God follows the promptings of the heart, the jnani uses the powers of the mind to discriminate between the real and the unreal, the permanent and the transitory Jnanis, followers of nondualistic or advaita Vedanta, can also be called monists for they affirm the sole reality of Brahman Of course, all followers of Vedanta are monists  all Vedantins affirm the sole reality of Brahman   The distinction here is in spiritual practice  while all Vedantins are philosophically monistic, inpractice those who are devotees of God prefer to think of God as distinct from themselves in order to enjoy the sweetness of a relationship Jnanis, by contrast, know that all duality is ignorance There is no need to look outside ourselves for divinity  we ourselves already are divine Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object    The Path of Work  Karma Yoga    Karma yoga is the yoga of action or work  specifically, it is the path of dedicated work i.e renouncing the results of our actions as a spiritual offering rather than hoarding the results for ourselves Karma is both action and the result of action What we experience today is the result of our karma both good and bad created by our previous actions This chain of cause and effect that we ourselves have created can be snapped by karma yoga  By disengaging the ego from the work process, by offering the results up to a higher power whether a personal God or to the Self within we stop the whole snowballing process As long as we require someone or something to make us happy we are slaves  Whether we realize it or not, all of us perform actions all the time since even sitting and thinking is action Since action is inevitable, an integral part of being alive, we need to reorient it into a path to God-realization A man should not be judged by the nature of his duties, but by the manner in which he does them    The Path of Meditation  Raja Yoga    Raja yoga, is the royal path of meditation As a king maintains control over his kingdom, so we can maintain control over our own &quot kingdom&quot  the vast territory of the mind In raja yoga we use our mental powers to realize the Atman through the process of psychological control  The first stage of this yoga is Yama To master Yama five things are necessary     Non-injuring any being by thought, word and deed  Speaking the truth in thought, word and deed  Non-convetousness in thought, word and deed  Perfect chastity in thought, word and deed  Perfect sinlessness in thought, word and deed    The other stages are     Pratyahara or the restraint of the organs of sense from all outward things and focusing on mental impressions  Dharana or steadfast concentration  Dhyana or meditation  Samadhi or abstract meditation, which the last stage of meditation and perfect absorption of thought into the Supreme Spirit, when one realizes, “Me and my Father are one.”    Now when the question arises that how are they complementary to each other, it’s very clear that even though these four paths or yogas appear different, there is really only one Yoga, one Union We may be drawn to one Path more than the others but they complement each other As the saying goes, “All roads lead to Rome,” so all Paths lead to Enlightenment   The four different yogas or paths are like four different strands woven together to form the same rope, each one strengthened by the others Choose whichever aspects of each path, they will resonate with us the same unity, the same Divinity Saturday, 15 August, 2020
