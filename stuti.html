   <p><span style="color:#000000;">Life would never be the same again. <br>
While this virus creates havoc killing in thousands, we have got accustomed to the NEW NORMAL.<br>
We all wished to return back to our normal lives, to our jobs, schools and colleges as soon as possible. Being at home was like being caged but to our utter dismay the lockdown only got extended. We had no option but to sit at home. <br>
We all went through some sort of depression. Many lost their jobs, some worked without salaries and some with 70% deductions. They were worried as to how they will provide for themselves and their families.<br>
Educational institutions were closed, final exams delayed, placements cancelled and career bleak. Students were worried, “will there be jobs for us when we pass out?” “When will we again join classes?”, “when will final exams be conducted?” were our questions but we knew nobody has an answer. Online learning was given a boost but still not every student can afford a smart phone and an internet connection.<br>
For those who stayed in quarantine being COVID positive or not, isolated in the same house from everyone is terrifying. How long can a man stay alone? it definitely puts a lot of pressure on one’s mind. You feel that though you have loved ones you still have none, you get impatient, angry and irritable and feel like bursting out on your loved ones. It is the time for you to be patient because it is the pandemic that separates you, but nothing breaks the love they have for you. <br>
This pandemic exposed to us all the misery and pain of the migrant workers, those in institutional quarantine, many were pushed back to poverty, recovery from which is a distant dream, factories, industries shut down. GDP is down by 23.9% and we may sink into recession. Maybe the worst is still awaited.<br>
Yet COVID has in many ways changed the way we live. We have all become very careful about our health. We know that mask is compulsory, however suffocating it may be for many of us.<br>
We realised that we can stay at home and spend time with our families. I have seen families play ludo, carrom and cards together, watch Mahabharat, Ramayana together. Street food like chowmein, chicken roll, chat, etc being prepared at home and Yes!! by our mothers. <br>
I felt privileged that I have a roof over my head. Not only me but many. I have food to eat. What more was needed when the basics to survive are there?<br>
People discovered their hobbies and many made new hobbies like coding, dancing, cooking, singing, etc. Busy days had taken from us the time to pursue what we love doing. People went back to reading, painting, playing their favourite instrument which earlier remained inside their covers and last but not the least we learnt to be patient, sit at a place and thank God that he still kept us safe!!<br>
We should all be thankful to our warriors, who are exposed to this deadly virus every day. We should all be thankful to the doctors, police, NGO volunteers who are working at the ground level. Many have lost their lives to this disease. We should not let their sacrifice go in vain. We should all abide by the rules and stay in until and unless things come back to normal. Let’s hope and pray that things come back to normal soon, be it the NEW NORMAL.</span><br><span class="blogdate">Thursday, September 10, 2020</span></p>
